#### Q-1 Type of Triangle

- Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
- Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
- Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
- Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
- Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

```bash
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene'
    END
FROM TRIANGLES;
```

#### Q-2 The PADS

- Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.


Output :- 

Ashely(P)
Christeen(P)
Jane(A)
Jenny(D)
Julia(A)
Ketty(P)
Maria(A)
Meera(S)
Priya(S)
Samantha(D)
There are a total of 2 doctors.
There are a total of 2 singers.
There are a total of 3 actors.
There are a total of 3 professors.

```bash
SELECT CONCAT(Name,'(' , LEFT(occupation,1),')') AS a 
FROM OCCUPATIONS
UNION
SELECT  CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(Occupation), ' ', LOWER(Occupation), 's.') AS a
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY Occupation
ORDER BY NAME ASC;
