#### Q-10 Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

```bash
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC LIMIT 1;

or 

SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY),CITY LIMIT 1;
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC LIMIT 1;

```


#### Q-11 Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

```bash
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(CITY, '^[AEIOU]');

or 



SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE 'A%'
   OR CITY LIKE 'E%'
   OR CITY LIKE 'I%'
   OR CITY LIKE 'O%'
   OR CITY LIKE 'U%';

```

#### Q-12 Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
```bash
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE lcase(CITY) LIKE '%a'
OR lcase(CITY) LIKE '%e'
OR lcase(CITY) LIKE '%i'
OR lcase(CITY) LIKE '%o'
OR lcase(CITY) LIKE '%u'
